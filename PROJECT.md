# GTFS Boss Project Roadmap

## Project Vision
GTFS Boss aims to be a comprehensive tool for transit agencies to validate, monitor, and analyze their GTFS feeds. The focus is on providing accurate, real-time insights while maintaining a clean, intuitive interface.

## Core Principles
1. **Accuracy First**: All GTFS validations and real-time data must be precise and reliable
2. **User-Centric Design**: Interface should be intuitive for transit planners and schedulers
3. **Performance**: Real-time updates must be efficient and responsive
4. **Maintainability**: Code should be clean, documented, and easily extensible

## Current Focus Areas

### 1. GTFS Validation
- [x] Basic GTFS feed validation
- [x] Real-time GTFS feed validation
- [ ] Enhanced validation rules
- [ ] Custom validation rules support

### 2. Real-Time Monitoring
- [x] Vehicle position tracking
- [x] Schedule adherence monitoring
- [x] Color-coded status indicators
- [ ] Historical performance analysis
- [ ] Alert system integration

### 3. Map Visualization
- [x] Route display
- [x] Stop locations
- [x] Vehicle positions
- [x] Interactive popups
- [ ] Route comparison
- [ ] Service coverage analysis

## UI Guidelines

### Map Interface
1. **Colors**
   - Routes: Use agency's route colors when available
   - Vehicles: 
     - Green: On time (±1 min)
     - Yellow: Minor delay (±3 min)
     - Red: Major delay (>3 min)
   - Stops: White with black border
   - Alerts: Red with warning icon

2. **Interactions**
   - Click: Show detailed information
   - Hover: Change cursor to pointer
   - Zoom: Maintain context and readability
   - Pan: Smooth transitions

3. **Popups**
   - Routes: Show route details, ID, description
   - Stops: Show stop name, ID, description
   - Vehicles: Show status, route, direction, schedule

### Layout
1. **Map Controls**
   - Position: Top right
   - Style: Minimal, non-intrusive
   - Functionality: Zoom, pan, layer toggle

2. **Legend**
   - Position: Bottom right
   - Style: Semi-transparent background
   - Content: Vehicle status colors

3. **Information Panels**
   - Position: Left side
   - Style: Collapsible, clean design
   - Content: Validation results, alerts, settings

   - Follow FastAPI best practices
   - Maintain API documentation
   - Write comprehensive tests
   - Use type hints

### Performance
1. **Map Rendering**
   - Optimize layer updates
   - Implement efficient clustering
   - Use appropriate zoom levels

2. **Data Updates**
   - Implement efficient polling
   - Use WebSocket when appropriate
   - Cache static data

### Security
1. **API Security**
   - Implement proper authentication
   - Validate all inputs
   - Sanitize outputs
   - Rate limit requests

2. **Data Protection**
   - Secure sensitive data
   - Implement proper access controls
   - Regular security audits

## Review Process
1. All UI changes must:
   - Follow the established guidelines
   - Maintain consistency
   - Improve user experience
   - Not compromise performance

2. Code reviews should check for:
